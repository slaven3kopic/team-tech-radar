            <h3>What is the Team Tech Radar?</h3>
            The Team Tech Radar is a list of technologies used by a particular team, complemented by an assessment result,
            called <i>ring assignment</i>. Four rings are used with the following semantics:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>ADOPT</b> — Technologies the team have high confidence in to serve the teams purpose, also in large scale.
            Technologies with a usage culture in the teams production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
            <br>
            <b>TRIAL</b> — Technologies that the team have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem;
            first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly
            more risky; some engineers in our team walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
            <br>
            <b>ASSESS</b> — Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for the team; technologies
            worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher
            risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our team. You will find some engineers that have knowledge
            in the technology and promote it, you may even find engineers that have started a prototyping effort.
            <br>
            <b>HOLD</b> — Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that the team thinks are not
            (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be
            continued for existing projects.
